  abstract = {This landmark handbook collects in a single volume the current state of cutting-edge research on the capability approach. It includes a comprehensive introduction to the approach as well as new research from leading scholars in this increasingly influential multi-disciplinary field, including the pioneers of capability research, Martha C. Nussbaum and Amartya Sen. Incorporating both approachable introductory chapters and more in-depth analysis relating to the central philosophical, conceptual and theoretical issues of capability research, this handbook also includes analytical and measurement tools, as well as policy approaches which have emerged in the recent literature. The handbook will be an invaluable resource for students approaching the capability approach for the first time as well as for researchers engaged in advanced research in a wide range of disciplines, including development studies, economics, gender studies, political science and political philosophy.},

  abstract = {IntroductionPropose. Break. Propose again. So pre-modern cryptography cycled. An encryption scheme was proposed; a cryptanalyst broke it; a modification, or even a completely new scheme, was proposed. Nothing ensured that the new scheme would in any sense be better than the old. Among the astonishing breakthroughs of modern cryptography is the methodology of rigorously defining the goal of a cryptographic primitive -- what it means to break the primitive -- and providing a clear delineation of the power -- information, computational ability -- of the adversary to be resisted (Goldwasser and Micali 1984; Goldwasser et al. 1988). Then, for any proposed method, one proves that no adversary of the specified class can break the primitive. If the class of adversaries captures all feasible adversaries, the scheme can be considered to achieve the stated goal.This does not mean the scheme is invulnerable, as the goal may have been too weak to capture the full demands placed on the primitive. For example, when the cryptosystem needs to be secure against a passive eavesdropper the requirements are weaker than when the cryptosystem needs to be secure against an active adversary that can determine whether or not arbitrary ciphertexts are well formed (such an attack was successfully launched against PKCS\#1; Bleichenbacher 1998). In this case the goal may be reformulated to be strictly more stringent than the original goal, and a new system proposed (and proved). This strengthening of the goal converts the propose--break--propose again cycle into a path of progress.},

  abstract = {Massive amounts of data on human beings can now be analyzed. Pragmatic purposes abound, including selling goods and services, winning political campaigns, and identifying possible terrorists. Yet "big data" can also be harnessed to serve the public good: scientists can use big data to do research that improves the lives of human beings, improves government services, and reduces taxpayer costs. In order to achieve this goal, researchers must have access to this data - raising important privacy questions. What are the ethical and legal requirements? What are the rules of engagement? What are the best ways to provide access while also protecting confidentiality? Are there reasonable mechanisms to compensate citizens for privacy loss? The goal of this book is to answer some of these questions. The book's authors paint an intellectual landscape that includes legal, economic, and statistical frameworks. The authors also identify new practical approaches that simultaneously maximize the utility of data access while minimizing information risk.},

  abstract = {Commodities and Capabilities presents a set of inter-related theses concerning the foundations of welfare economics, and in particular about the assessment of personal well-being and advantage. The argument presented focuses on the capability to function, i.e. what a person can do or can be, questioning in the process the more standard emphasis on opulence or on utility. In fact, a person's motivation behind choice is treated here as a parametric variable which may or may not coincide with the pursuit of self-interest. Given the large number of practical problems arising from the roles and limitations of different concepts of interest and the judgement of advantage and well-being, this scholarly investigation is both of theoretical interest and practical import.},

  abstract = {Several methodological approaches have been used to estimate distance in health service research. In this study, focusing on cardiac catheterization services, Euclidean, Manhattan, and the less widely known Minkowski distance metrics are used to estimate distances from patient residence to hospital. Distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. Therefore, distance metrics, unlike actual measurements, can be directly used in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance is most often used, but unlikely the most appropriate metric. Minkowski distance is a more promising method. Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling.},
